# Time

In this file we define the time worldvolume as a real line.

## Note on implementation

The definition of `Time` currently inherits all instances of
`ℝ`.

This, in particular, automatically equips `Time` with a
norm. This norm induces a metric on `Time` which is the standard
flat metric. Thus `Time` automatically corresponds to
flat time.

The definition of `deriv` through `fderiv` explicitly uses this metric.

`Time` also inherits instances of `ℝ` such as
a zero vector, the ability to add two time positions etc, which
are not really allowed operations on `Time`.
