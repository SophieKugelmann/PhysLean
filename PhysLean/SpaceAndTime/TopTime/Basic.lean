# Topological Time

This directory is currently a stub.

It is intended to contain the definition of time in the absence of a metric, that is to say,
time where the distance between two time points is not defined.

There are a number of places in physics where this is relavant, but
primarily it is used in the study of topological field theories and topological terms.
