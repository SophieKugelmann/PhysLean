# The field labels

## i. Overview

To each field and it's conjugate in the `SU(5)` SUSY GUT we assign a label,
namely an element of the inductive type `FieldLabel`.

This field label will be used to specify the representations of fields present in
terms of the lagrangian.

## ii. Key results

The key results are
- `FieldLabel` : the inductive type of field labels.
- `FieldLabel.RParity` : the R-parity of a field label, being `1` if it is in
  the non-trivial representation and `0` otherwise.

## A. The field labels

The inductive type `FieldLabel` is defined, with one constructor for each field
and it's conjugate present in the `SU(5)` SUSY GUT.

Note that there is only one `10` representation, as it is self-conjugate.

## B. R-parity of a field label

We define the R-parity of a field label, being `1` if it is in the non-trivial
representation and `0` otherwise.
