# Electrostatics

Electrostatics corresponds to the study of electric fields and potentials in the absence of
time variation or magnetic fields.

The study of electrostatics usually necessitates the use of distributions, since point charges
are often used to model charged particles. The formal definition of such distributions
are often glossed over in physics. As a result some of the definitions or proofs
within PhysLean's electrostatics may seem over the top - but this is necessary for complete
mathematical correctness.
