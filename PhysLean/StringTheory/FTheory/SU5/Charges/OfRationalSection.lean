# Allowed charges

## i. Overview

Within SU(5) F-theory with 10d and 5-bar matter fields there are constraints on the
allowed U(1) charges the fields can have.
These constraints are determined in arXiv:1504.05593. They are related to the
distinct configurations of the zero-section (`σ₀`) relativity to the
additional rational section (`σ₁`s) in codimension one fiber.
For our purposes here, we currently just state the constraints found
in arXiv:1504.05593, and leave the proof and derivation of these constraints to future
work.

## ii. Key results

- `CodimensionOneConfig` : The distinct configurations of the
  zero-section (`σ₀`) relativity to the additional rational section (`σ₁`s) in
  the codimension one fiber, `I₅`.
- `CodimensionOneConfig.allowedBarFiveCharges` : The allowed
  `U(1)`-charges of matter in the 5-bar representation of `SU(5)`
  given a `CodimensionOneConfig`.
- `CodimensionOneConfig.allowedTenCharges` : The allowed
  `U(1)`-charges of matter in the 10d representation of `SU(5)`
  given a `CodimensionOneConfig`.

  zero-section (`σ₀`) relativity to the additional rational section (`σ₁`s). -/
inductive CodimensionOneConfig
  /-- `σ₀` and `σ₁` intersect the same `ℙ¹` of the `I₅` Kodaira fiber.
    This is sometimes denoted `I₅^{(01)}` -/
  | same : CodimensionOneConfig
  /-- `σ₀` and `σ₁` intersect the nearest neighbor `ℙ¹`s of the `I₅` Kodaira fiber.
    This is sometimes denoted `I₅^{(0|1)}` -/
  | nearestNeighbor : CodimensionOneConfig
  /-- `σ₀` and `σ₁` intersect the next to nearest neighbor `ℙ¹`s of the `I₅` Kodaira fiber.
    This is sometimes denoted `I₅^{(0||1)}` -/
