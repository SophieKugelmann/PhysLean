## Aims of this project

üéØ __Digitalize__ results (meaning calculations, definitions, and theorems) from physics
into Lean 4.

üéØ Develop structures to aid the __creation__ of new results in physics using Lean,
  with the potential future use of AI.

üéØ Create good documentation so that the project can be used for __pedagogical__ purposes.

## How to get involved

See the [Get Involved](https://physlean.com/GetInvolved.html) for more details. Some suggestions:

üì£ write **informal** results - no need to learn Lean for this - see the [Getting Started](https://physlean.com/GettingStarted) page for more details,

üì£ tackle a [TODO item](https://physlean.com/TODOList),

üì£ or, start formalizing an area that you find intresting.

Feel free to come to the [PhysLean zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/479953-PhysLean/) to ask questions and advice.

> [!NOTE]
> When making contributing to PhysLean it is much better to do it with small steps. This makes it easier for us to review, and allows you to get feedback sooner.

### Papers referencing PhysLean

How PhysLean (then called HepLean) was used: *Theorems from the space-time files of HepLean were included in a data set used to evaluate the ability of models to prove theorems from real-world repositories, which requires working with definitions, theorems, and other context not seen in training.*

## Contributing

We would love to have you involved! See the [Get Involved](https://physlean.com/GetInvolved.html) page to see how you can get involved.
Any contributions are welcome! If you have any questions or want permission  permission to create a pull-request for this
repository contact Joseph Tooby-Smith on the [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com), or email.

## Installation

If you want to play around with PhysLean, but do not want to download Lean, then you can use [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/HEPLean/HepLean).

### Installing Lean 4

Installation instructions for Lean 4 can be found:

- https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html

or

- https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html

### Installing PhysLean

- Clone this repository (or download the repository as a Zip file)
- Open a terminal at the top-level in the corresponding directory.
- Run `lake exe cache get`. The command `lake` should have been installed when you installed Lean.
- Run `lake build`.
- Open the directory (not a single file) in Visual Studio Code (or another Lean compatible code editor).
