# Scripts associated with PhysLean

## lint-style.py and lint-style.sh

Taken from Mathlib's linters. These perform text-based linting of the code.

These are to be slowly replaced with code written in Lean.

## hepLean_style_lint

Checks the following in PhysLean
- There are no double empty lines.
- There are no non-initial double spaces.
Passing this linter is currently not required to pass CI on github.

Run using
```
lake exe hepLean_style_lint
```

## check_file_imports.lean

Checks all files are correctly imported into `PhysLean.lean`.

Run using
```
lake exe check_file_imports
```

## type_former_lint.lean

Checks whether the name of definitions which form a type or prop starts with a capital letter.

Run using
```
lake exe type_former_lint
```

## stats.sh

Outputs statistics for PhysLean.

Run using
```
lake exe stats
```

## openAI_doc_check.lean

Uses openAI's API to check for spelling mistakes etc. in doc strings.

This code needs `https://github.com/jstoobysmith/Lean_llm_fork` to be installed.

It also needs the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined using e.g.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your-openAI-key>
```

Run on a specific file using
```
lake exe openAI_doc_check <module_name>
```
where `<module_name>` is e.g. `PhysLean.SpaceAndTime.SpaceTime.Basic`.

Run on a random file using
```
lake exe openAI_doc_check random
```

## lint-all.sh

Performs all linting checks on PhysLean.

Run using
```
./scripts/lint-all.sh
```

## Other useful commands

- To build PhysLean use
```
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

- To update PhysLean's dependencies use
```
lake update
```
